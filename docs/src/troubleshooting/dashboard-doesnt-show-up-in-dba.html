                    Verify that the required

                                    If you know where to find the installer, you can run it yourself on the affected
                                    machine. The installer is usually located over the network, wherever the DBA
                                    Manufacturing installation is, within the <code>Add-Ons\DBA
                                    AutoTools\Installers</code> folder.

                                    If you or the system administrator is unaware of where to find the installer for
                                    the latest version, please contact the original person responsible for
                                    installation, and let them know that a reinstallation is necessary.

                </li>
                <li>
                    Verify that the program is running by checking for the 
                    <a href="installation-checks/tray-icon-menu.html">Tray Icon</a> and
                    <a href="installation-checks/processes.html">Processes</a> that should exist.

                            If the <strong>Tray Icon</strong> is missing but the <strong>Processes</strong> are
                            running, try ending the process and restarting the program from the Desktop Icon. Then,
                            verify again that the program is running by checking for the Tray Icon and the running
                            Processes.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If the <strong>Tray Icon</strong> is missing and the <strong>Processes</strong> do not
                            exist, that means the program is not running and you must start the program from the
                            Desktop Icon. Then, verify that the program is running by checking for the Tray Icon and
                            the running Processes.

                    If you have performed all of the steps above and the DBA AutoTools dashboard still is not
                    showing, please contact the person responsible for installating the program for further
                    troubleshooting.

                <p>
                    As long as DBA AutoTools is running in the background, the expected behavior is that the DBA AutoTools
                    dashboard will appear in the main DBA Manufacturing screen, like below:
                </p>
                <div class="figure">
                    <img src="img/dba-autotools-dashboard.png">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>
                If the DBA AutoTools dashboard does not appear as it does in the above image, that means something is not functioning
                as expected.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <a id="potential-causes-solutions"></a>
            <h2>Potential Causes/Solutions</h2>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Cause: DBA AutoTools is not running</h3>
                <p>
                    In order for the DBA AutoTools dashboard to show up, the program must be running in the background.
                    You can verify whether or DBA AutoTools is running by checking for the 
                    <a href="installation-checks/tray-icon-menu.html">Tray Icon</a> as well as the 
                    <a href="installation-checks/processes.html">Processes</a> which indicate the programming is
                    running properly.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If the <strong>Tray Icon</strong> is missing but the <strong>Processes</strong> are running, try
                    closing the <a href="installation-checks/processes.html">Processes</a> from the <em>Task
                    Manager</em>, and restarting the program from the 
                    <a href="installation-checks/shortcuts.html#public-desktop-folder">shortcut</a> that should exist 
                    on the desktop. Then verify that the <strong>Tray Icon</strong> exists, and that the DBA AutoTools
                    dashboard is appearing properly within the DBA Manufacturing program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If neither the <strong>Tray Icon</strong> nor the <strong>Processes</strong> exist, try launching
                    the program from the icon on the desktop. Then, verify that the <strong>Tray Icon</strong> and
                    <strong>Processes</strong> exists, and that the DBA AutoTools dashboard is appearing properly within
                    the DBA Manufacturing program.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If neither of the above steps solves the problem, continue to the next section.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h3>Cause: DBA AutoTools is not properly installed</h3>
                <p>
                    In order for the DBA AutoTools dashboard to appear, the program has to be properly installed. If you
                    tried the steps above, and the program would not start properly, this most likely means that there
                    is a problem with the installation.  Please review and follow any troubleshooting steps found in the
                    <a href="installation-checks.html">Installation Checks</a>, in particular the section on 
                    <a href="installation-checks/filesystem.html#executables">Executables</a>. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once you've reviewed the installation checks, attempt to open the DBA AutoTools program again from
                    the desktop shortcut and verify that the <strong>Tray Icon</strong> and <strong>Processes</strong>
                    exist. Then, verify that the DBA AutoTools dashboard shows up in the DBA Manufacturing screen. 
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                If you've reached this point and the DBA AutoTools dashboard still isn't appearing properly, please
                contact the person responsible for installing the program originally to troubleshoot further.
