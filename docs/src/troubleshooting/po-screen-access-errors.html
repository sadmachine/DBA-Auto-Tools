                If you receive a message from DBA when you attempt to open the PO Screen that says something along the
                lines of <em>"A component named frmPurchase already exists"</em> OR <em>"Access Violation error in EJSME.EXE"</em>, 
                this is actually a known issue with DBA Manufacturing, and doesn't have anything to do with the DBA AutoTools
                program.
            </p>

            <p>
                DBA Manufacturing has a support article related to this issue, which can be found 
                <a href="https://support.dbamanufacturing.com/support/solutions/articles/35000005586-receiving-an-error-when-launching-the-po-screen">here</a>.

                The fix for this issue is essentially to make sure that the computer has a default printer assigned. If there is already a default printer assigned, try assigning a different printer as the default, then reassigning the original printer as the default again.
                You can find an article on how to assign default printers in Windows <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-a-default-printer-in-windows-e10cf8b8-e596-b102-bf84-c41022b5036f#:~:text=a%20default%20printer%3A-,Select%20Start%20%3E%20Settings%20.,printer%20option%20may%20be%20selected.">here</a>.
