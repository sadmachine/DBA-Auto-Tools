                    Try all steps below. If none of them fix the issue, contact the original installer of the program for
                    further troubleshooting.

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Verify that the <code>QueueManager.exe</code> process is running on the machine (see
                        <a href="installation-checks/processes.html#expected-processes">Processes</a>)
                        <ul>

                                If it's not, close the existing <code>DBA AutoTools.exe</code> process (if it is running) and
                                restart the DBA AutoTools application. The easiest way to restart the application is to
                                double-click the shortcut that can be found on the desktop, which should be called "DBA
                                AutoTools".
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Once the program is restarted, verify that the <code>QueueManager.exe</code> process exists,
                                and that the log files are getting generated/updated again. If not, continue to the next step.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify that the log file is not already opened in excel by someone. The log file cannot be updated
                        while it is already open.
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If the excel file is open by someone, have them close the excel and free up the file to
                                be updated.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If no one has the file open and the log files still aren't generating/updating, continue
                                to the next step.
                            </li>

                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify that there aren't any leftover hidden <em>lockfiles</em> (see
                        <a href="#lock-files">here</a> for more info on how to verify this)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If there is a leftover <em>lockfile</em>, and you've already verified that nobody has the file open, attempt to delete the file.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If you were able to delete the file without getting a permission issue, verify that the log files are properly updating/generating again.

            <h2>Problem Description</h2>
            <p>
                During normal execution of the program, there are several document (log) operations that could occur. A
                document could be updated, or a new document could be generated. Each of these operations is initiated 
                by a <em>job</em> that is waiting in the <em>job queue</em>; this is done so that the jobs can be processed
                in parallel to normal automation operations without the program having to wait for them to complete, and so 
                that the <em>jobs</em> can be retried if they fail.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes certain circumstances can lead to the <em>job queue</em> becoming stuck or locked up, or the process
                responsible for handling the jobs in the queue might not be running, which would prevent them from getting
                processed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thankfully, because we create and store the information that needs to be processed in these <em>jobs</em>, 
                when things get stuck none of the information gets lost, and once we get the queue "unstuck" the jobs will
                get processed where they left off as if nothing happened.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <a id="potential-causes-solutions"></a>
            <h2>Potential Causes/Solutions</h2>
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Cause: <code>QueueManager.exe</code> is not running</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above, these document updating/generation tasks are handled as jobs in a queue. The process
                    responsible for handling these jobs is called <code>QueueManager.exe</code>. When <code>DBA AutoTools.exe</code>
                    is started, it should automatically start <code>QueueManager.exe</code>. Under certain rare circumstances though,
                    the process may not get run or may have been stopped accidentally. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The best way to restart the process is by restarting DBA AutoTools itself. This is accomplished by closing
                    any existing <code>DBA AutoTools.exe</code> process (see 
                    <a href="installation-checks/processes.html#expected-processes">Expected Processes</a>), then
                    restarting it by double-clicking the DBA AutoTools desktop icon. Once the program starts, it should
                    run <code>QueueManager.exe</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Verify that <code>QueueManager.exe</code> is properly running after restarting <code>DBA
                    AutoTools.exe</code>, and also verify that the documents are properly generating/updating.
                    If they are not, continue on to the next step.
                </p>
            </div>  
            <div class="section">
                <h3>Cause: the file is currently open by another user</h3>

                <p>
                    If the relevant file that is supposed to be updated is already opened by another user, the program 
                    will be unable to update the file until it is closed. The file is essentially in <em>Read-Only</em>
                    mode until it is closed. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    Ask around to anyone who would have the file open, and make sure they close out of it if it is open.
                    Once the file is closed, wait for a short period of time, maybe 1 to 5 minutes, and then reopen the file
                    to verify that is has been updated properly. If it has not, continue on to the next step.
                </p>

            <div class="section">
                <a id="lock-files"></a>
                <h3>Cause: there are leftover hidden <em>lockfiles</em></h3>

                <p>
                    When certain documents are open, they create what are called <em>lockfiles</em>. These files 
                    exist to control access of a document, and tell the computer that the file is already open and
                    "locked" so that two or more users don't edit the same file at the same time, which can potentially
                    cause conflicts/issues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These <em>lockfiles</em> are meant to be deleted one a user closes the file, but under certain circumstances
                    they can get left behind and falsely identify a file as open. When this happens, the file will perpetually
                    remain in "Read-Only" mode until the hanging lockfile is deleted.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Generally these lockfiles are hidden, so you have to set your computer to show hidden files in order to
                    find and delete them. You can find an article <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/view-hidden-files-and-folders-in-windows-97fbc472-c603-9d90-91d0-1166d1d9f4b5">here</a>
                    on how to show hidden files. 
                </p>

                <div class="p-group">
                    <p>
                        Once you have set your computer to show hidden files, you need to navigate to the directory/folder where the
                        document that is supposed to get updated is located. Once there, if you see a file that starts with <code>~$</code>,
                        this is the file that needs to be deleted. For instance, if your file is name <code>Document.xlsx</code>, there
                        will be a file called <code>~$cument.xlsx</code>, and it will be slightly greyed out (indicating its a hidden file).
                    </p>
                    <div class="figure">
                        <img src="img/hidden-files-example.png">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Once you have verified that no one has the document open, attempt to delete the lockfile. If it deletes without giving any
                    errors, wait a short period of time, 1 to 5 minutes, then reopen the document and see if the updates are there. If not,
                    further troubleshooting is necessary.
                </p>

                If you've reached this point and the DBA AutoTools dashboard still isn't appearing properly, please
                contact the person responsible for installing the program originally to troubleshoot further.
